# Functional Playground

This repo has examples of functional programming in JavaScript. Functional programming is more than just using functions to write all of your code. It also involves the self-discipline of never using a side effect. A side effect is defined to be mutating any state outside the location where it was declared. People who adhere to functional paradigms not only believe that side-effects cause a large amount of bugs in code that use them, but also that it is incredibly difficult to prove that code does what you think it does when side-effects are not avoided.
